Some kind of forth-like thing that compiles into WebAssembly. Can do hello world and fibonacci numbers

I called it Candyforth because I was planning to use it for something christmas-related initially. Other name candidates:
- Decemberforth
- Santaforth
- Rudolph

Quick guide: Put something like the contents of *fib.cf* into *cforth/test.cfs* and run ```npm run go```
